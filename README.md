# üè® Hotel Room Booking System

A simple, console-based hotel room booking system written in Java.

## üìú Description

This project is a command-line application that allows users to manage a hotel's room bookings. Users can view available rooms, make new bookings, view all existing bookings, and cancel a booking. The application data is persisted to CSV files, so the state is saved between sessions.

## ‚ú® Features

- **View All Rooms:** See a list of all rooms in the hotel, including their type, price, and availability.
- **Search for Available Rooms:** Find rooms that are available for a given date range.
- **Make a Booking:** Book a room for a customer for a specific period.
- **View All Bookings:** See a list of all current bookings.
- **Cancel a Booking:** Cancel an existing booking by its ID.
- **Data Persistence:** All room and booking data is saved to and loaded from CSV files in the `data` directory.
